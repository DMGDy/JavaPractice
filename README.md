# Some poor CIS Student's Lab #2

It looks like its supposed to be some CLI application
that stores sales information to produce an invoice.

## Dependencies

* POSIX Shell interpreter (sorry Windows noobs)
* `javac`
* A Java runtime environment 
* A brain

## Building/Running

I didn't want to use Netbeans or any IDE because
they are trash. Apache Ant and their build system
is just as trash as well. Just run the 
shell script. 
```
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
This was constructed on neovim
and tested on the kitty terminal emulator inside
of a tmux session.
